40641|a|E, F. Increased S-phase arrest in HUWE1-knockout 293T (E) and HeLa (F) cells. Cycling cells were incubated with BrdU and subjected to BrdU/PI bi-dimensional flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometry profiles are presented in Fig EV1D-F. Bars represent the fold increase in the percentage of cells with S-phase DNA content (between 2N and 4N) but negative for BrdU staining. Bars represent the average of three independent experiments, with error bars showing SD. The p-values are 0.0091 (E) and 0.0007 (F).
